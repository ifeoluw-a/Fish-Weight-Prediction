## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following features:
- **Species**: The species of the fish.
- **Length1**: Vertical length in cm.
- **Length2**: Diagonal length in cm.
- **Length3**: Cross length in cm.
- **Height**: Height of the fish in cm.
- **Width**: Diagonal width in cm.
- **Weight**: The weight of the fish (target variable).

## Model
The model used for prediction is a regression model, specifically:

Linear Regression
Polynomial Regression
Decision Tree Regressor
The models were trained and evaluated using scikit-learn.

## Results
The model achieved a mean absolute error (MAE) of 50.6 and an R-squared value of 95.5% on the test set. For detailed results, see the results/ directory.
